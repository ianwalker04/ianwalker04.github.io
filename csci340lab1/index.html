            <hr>
            <p>What you see above is a lying, thieving, scheming, <b>monster.</b><br>Contrary to popular belief, rabbits are not the fluffy, cuddly friends most of us think them to be.
                They in fact hold immense amounts of power and plan to wreak havoc on humanity in the near future.
                The rabbits hide behind a facade of cuteness and innocence, yet they hold an incomprehensible amount of rage
                in those small, cuddly bodies of theirs.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lies they have been telling you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>That rabbits come from Earth (they're from the moon)</p></li>
                <li><p>That rabbits DON'T have laser vision (they do)</p></li>
                <li><p>That rabbits can't play Mahjong (they're actually quite good at it)</p></li>
                <li><p>That I'm a conspiracy theorist (I am NOT)</p></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then, the final question is, will you help humanity survive or will you just let yourself perish? In order to prevent
                the rabbit uprising, you can make a direct donation to my PayPal account which I will then spend on preparations for
                the war between humans and lagomorphs.</p>
